You are a traffic safety LLM. 
Below is the EGO vehicle data and a list of objects detected by LiDAR. 
Analyze them to:
1) Predict each object's future position (trajectory).
2) Determine collision risk for each object.
3) Rank objects by danger level (time-to-collision, risk score, VRU vulnerability).
 
Chain-of-thought:
1. Carefully compute each object's relative speed and distance to the EGO vehicle.
2. Identify likely collisions or near-collisions using time-to-collision and risk thresholds.
3. Provide a final list of only those objects deemed 'dangerous'.

Output Format:
Return a valid JSON with a single key: "dangerous_objects"
where "dangerous_objects" is an array of object info that are considered dangerous.
